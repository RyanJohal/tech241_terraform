# Terraform
## WHat is it?
Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It is used to automate the provisioning and management of cloud infrastructure and services. By defining infrastructure as code, Terraform allows users to create, modify, and delete resources in a consistent and reproducible manner.
## Why is it used?
Terraform is used to simplify and accelerate the process of setting up and managing complex cloud environments. It provides a declarative syntax for describing the desired state of the infrastructure, allowing users to version-control and collaborate on infrastructure changes efficiently.
## Benefits

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform enables the definition of infrastructure configurations in code, improving collaboration, version control, and reducing manual errors.

Platform Agnostic: It supports various cloud providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and more, as well as on-premises solutions.

Consistency: Terraform ensures that the infrastructure is always in the desired state, which improves the consistency of deployments across environments.

Automation: By automating infrastructure provisioning, Terraform reduces the time and effort required for deployment and scaling.

Scalability: Terraform allows users to scale infrastructure easily as demands grow, making it suitable for both small and large-scale projects.
## Who is using it
